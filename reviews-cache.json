You won\u2019t get a more honest review of camping products and high quality selection. I trust no technician more than Justin to work on my motorhome. He is extremely knowledgeable and honest. There is a reason they always have a wait list for service. I expect perfection and he always delivers. Prices are by far the best in town.",

            "text": "Super friendly and knowledgeable staff. Very helpful when it came to our entire purchasing process from viewing the camper to bringing a unit home. No upcharges to get out the door. The starter package that Norman includes is great...it includes everything you need to get to camping right away. They also took time to inspect the travel trailer before we left with it to make sure everything was fully functional. Highly recommend!\n\nEdit - one year after ownership and I can still say the folks at Norman are great. I had a few minor warranty items to be resolved with my camper and Norman took care of them promptly!",

After almost 4 years Tim and Ryan went to bat for me with the manufacturer and got my repairs 100% covered. I knew Tim was a man of his word, but he truly does care about his customers and doing the right thing! I 100% recommend them and Puma if you are shopping for a camper.",

I needed assistance with a warranty repair for my Forest River RPod and I was struggling to find someone who could manage it all. After calling Forest River, the part company and the dealer the Forest River site recommended, I finally found Norman Campers. They navigated the warranty, got me in quickly for my repair (toilet replacement), and had me back on the road in time for the weekend. It is always a relief to find honest people who love what they do.",
